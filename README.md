# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game_Project
A simple C++ Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer for a set number of rounds. The screen color changes based on the resultâ€”green for a win, red for a loss, and yellow for a tie. At the end, game statistics are displayed, showing wins, losses, and ties.
